# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview

We have been tasked with organizing and analyzing P-H's employment data in order to provide insights into potential near future retirements. This should allow P-H to take steps in the present to mitigate any potential negative outcomes for the business. Analysis is multi-factor, providing breakdowns across various departments, title, etc.


## Results

* Potential retirements, as defined by our rough age criteria, is heavily weighted towards Senior Engineers and Senior Staff, as can be seen here:

* Lesser but still significant losses may be seen in non-Senior general Staff and Engineers

* There appears to be minimal Management exposure.

* There is a moderate-to-small population of Mentorship-qualified employees who we may be able to use to ease the transition, seen here:

## Summary

Overall, we are looking at filling upwards of 90,398 positions in the near future, give or take. While our population of Mentorship-qualified employees can help, they are dwarfed by the size of the retirements, numbering only 1549. They are also misballanced proportional to the upcoming losses, as can be seen above, particularly with regard to Senior Engineers.
